# Release Process

This document describes the automated release process for feedback-loop using GoReleaser.

## Overview

The release pipeline is fully automated:
1. Code merges to `main` trigger an automatic patch release
2. The auto-release checks skip conditions (bot actor, `[skip release]`, `skip-release` label)
3. If not skipped, it calls the version-bump workflow to create a tag and publish
4. GoReleaser builds binaries and publishes to GitHub Releases with auto-generated notes

For minor or major releases, maintainers trigger the version-bump workflow manually.

## Auto-Release

Every push to `main` that changes code files triggers `auto-release.yml`. Documentation-only changes (`.md`, `docs/`, `.beads/`, `.floop/`, `LICENSE`) are ignored via `paths-ignore`.

### Skip Mechanisms

| Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `github-actions[bot]` actor | Automatic — prevents version-bump commits from re-triggering |
| `[skip release]` in commit message | Batch multiple PRs before releasing |
| `skip-release` label on PR | Mark a PR as not release-worthy before merging |

### Example: Batching Changes

When you want to merge several PRs before cutting a release:

1. Add the `skip-release` label to each PR (or include `[skip release]` in merge commits)
2. Merge the PRs
3. On the last PR, remove the label (or omit the skip marker) — the auto-release triggers

## Manual Release (Minor/Major)

Release notes for minor and major releases automatically span back to the last tag of the same level — a minor release includes all commits since the previous `vX.Y.0`, and a major release since the previous `vX.0.0`. This means auto-patches between minor/major releases don't cause empty changelogs.

### 1. Prepare for Release

Ensure the `main` branch is ready:

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Verify tests pass
make test

# Verify CI suite passes
make ci

# Check for any uncommitted changes
git status
```

### 2. Choose Version Bump Type

| Bump Type | When to Use | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **patch** | Bug fixes, minor improvements (usually auto-released) | 0.1.0 → 0.1.1 |
| **minor** | New features, backwards-compatible API additions | 0.1.0 → 0.2.0 |
| **major** | Breaking changes, major architectural changes | 0.1.0 → 1.0.0 |

**Current versioning stage**: Pre-1.0 (0.x.x)
- Use `minor` for new features or significant changes
- Use `patch` for bug fixes
- Reserve `major` for when ready to commit to API stability (1.0.0)

### 3. Trigger Version Bump

```bash
# For a minor release (0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
gh workflow run version-bump.yml -f bump=minor

# For a major release (0.1.0 → 1.0.0)
gh workflow run version-bump.yml -f bump=major
```

Alternatively, use the GitHub web UI:
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select **Version Bump and Release** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Choose bump type from dropdown
5. Click **Run workflow**

### 4. Monitor Release

```bash
# Watch the workflow
gh run watch --workflow=version-bump.yml

# Or list recent runs
gh run list --workflow=version-bump.yml
```

### 5. Verify Release

```bash
# View the release
gh release view v0.2.0

# Download and test a binary
gh release download v0.2.0 -p "floop-v0.2.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz"
tar xzf floop-v0.2.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
./floop version
```

Expected output:
```
floop version v0.2.0 (commit: abc1234, built: 2026-02-10T15:30:00Z)
```

### 6. Announce Release

After verification:
- Update any deployment documentation
- Notify users via appropriate channels
- Update integration guides if needed

## Release Artifacts

Each release produces:

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **6 binaries** | linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64 |
| **Archives** | `.tar.gz` for Unix, `.zip` for Windows |
| **Checksums** | `checksums.txt` with SHA256 hashes |
| **Release notes** | Auto-generated by GoReleaser from conventional commits |

Archives include:
- `floop` binary
- `LICENSE`
- `README.md`
- `docs/` directory

## Local Testing

Test the release process locally before pushing:

```bash
# Install GoReleaser (if not already installed)
go install github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/v2@v2.8.0

# Validate configuration
goreleaser check

# Test build without publishing
goreleaser build --snapshot --clean

# Check built binaries
ls -lh dist/*/

# Test version injection
./dist/floop_linux_amd64_v1/floop version

# Test full release pipeline (doesn't publish)
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean

# Clean up
rm -rf dist/
```

## Version Information

All binaries include build metadata:

```bash
./floop version
# Output: floop version v0.2.0 (commit: abc1234, built: 2026-02-10T15:30:00Z)

./floop version --json
# Output: {"version":"v0.2.0","commit":"abc1234","date":"2026-02-10T15:30:00Z"}
```

**Version sources:**
- `version` — From git tag (e.g., `v0.2.0`)
- `commit` — Short git commit SHA
- `date` — Build timestamp (RFC3339)

**Development builds:**
- Built with `make build` show `version=dev`
- Include current commit SHA and build time

## Troubleshooting

### Release Workflow Fails

**Check GoReleaser logs:**
```bash
gh run view --log
```

**Common issues:**
- **Missing tag:** Ensure version bump workflow completed
- **Build failure:** Check `go.mod` and dependencies are up to date
- **Invalid config:** Run `goreleaser check` locally

### Wrong Version Tagged

If you need to delete and recreate a tag:

```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d v0.2.0

# Delete remote tag (careful!)
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.2.0

# Create new tag
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0"
git push origin v0.2.0
```

**Note:** Only do this immediately after tagging, before anyone downloads the release.

### Release Published but Broken

If a release is published but has issues:

1. **Don't delete the release** — it breaks links
2. Create a hotfix and release a new patch version
3. Update the broken release description with a warning and link to the fix

### Emergency Hotfix

For critical bugs in production:

```bash
# Create hotfix branch from the release tag
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug v0.2.0

# Fix the bug
# ... make changes ...

# Commit fix
git add .
git commit -m "fix: critical bug description"

# Push hotfix branch
git push origin hotfix/critical-bug

# Create PR to main
gh pr create --base main --title "fix: critical bug" --body "Emergency hotfix for v0.2.0"

# After PR merge, auto-release creates the patch automatically
```

## CI/CD Workflows

### auto-release.yml

**Trigger:** Push to `main` (code changes only, docs excluded)
**Purpose:** Automatically release patches when code merges

**Jobs:**
1. `check-skip` — Evaluate skip conditions (bot actor, commit message, PR label)
2. `release` — If not skipped, call `version-bump.yml` with `bump: patch`

### version-bump.yml

**Trigger:** Manual `workflow_dispatch` or `workflow_call` from auto-release
**Permissions:** `contents: write`
**Purpose:** Calculate next version, create tag, and publish release

**Inputs:**
- `bump`: `patch`, `minor`, or `major`

**Steps:**
1. Checkout with full history
2. Calculate next version from latest tag
3. Create annotated tag
4. Push tag
5. Checkout the new tag
6. Calculate changelog base tag (for minor/major, overrides GoReleaser's default)
7. Run GoReleaser with `release --clean`
8. Publish GitHub release artifacts and notes

### test-release.yml

**Trigger:** PR changes to release files
**Permissions:** `contents: read`
**Purpose:** Validate release config before merge

**Steps:**
1. Checkout code
2. Run GoReleaser in snapshot mode
3. Verify binaries work
4. Check for expected builds

## Configuration Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.goreleaser.yml` | GoReleaser configuration (builds, archives, changelog) |
| `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml` | Auto-patch on merge to main |
| `.github/workflows/version-bump.yml` | Version tagging and release workflow |
| `.github/workflows/test-release.yml` | PR validation workflow |
| `Makefile` | Local build with version injection |

## Future Enhancements

Not currently implemented but can be added later:

- **Homebrew tap** — Automatic formula updates
- **Docker images** — Multi-arch container publishing
- **Scoop manifest** — Windows package manager
- **AUR package** — Arch Linux user repository
- **Binary signing** — GPG or cosign signatures
- **SBOM generation** — Software bill of materials
- **Release channels** — Beta/RC releases

To add these, extend `.goreleaser.yml` with the appropriate sections. See [GoReleaser documentation](https://goreleaser.com/customization/) for details.
