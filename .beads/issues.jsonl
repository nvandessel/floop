New Command: `floop mcp-server`\nStart an MCP server over stdio that exposes floop functionality.\n\n### 2. MCP Tools to Expose\n| Tool | Description | Parameters |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| `floop_active` | Get active behaviors for context | `file`, `task` |\n| `floop_learn` | Capture a correction | `wrong`, `right`, `file` |\n| `floop_list` | List all behaviors | `--corrections` flag |\n\n### 3.
